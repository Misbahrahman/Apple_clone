            to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from
            the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will
            be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product
            discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product
            (i.e. the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a
